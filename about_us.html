            <p>This new offering enables immersive shopping experiences for video games, virtual worlds, and mobile
                apps, starting with the new augmented reality adventure pet game Peridot.</p>
            <p>Whether you’re playing video games or using your favorite mobile app, World Store is extending the fun
                within virtual worlds and interactive digital environments with a new immersive shopping experience
                called World Store Anywhere. With World Store Anywhere, you can now discover and buy physical products
                from World Store stores without ever having to leave your game or app. You can experience World Store
                Anywhere’s first launch within Peridot, a new real-world augmented reality game from Niantic (the makers
                of Pokémon Go). The game features unique virtual pets powered by artificial intelligence (AI), and it’s
                now available on iOS and Android devices.</p>
            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <p>World Store Anywhere helps bring the magic of Peridot from augmented reality to reality with an engaging
                in-game physical merchandise store. When playing Peridot, you can access physical products within the
                game as you care for one-of-a-kind creatures and explore the world together. After seamlessly linking
                your World Store account to Peridot, you can find Peridot-branded products such as T-shirts, hoodies,

            <h4>What’s different about World Store Anywhere?</h4>
            <p>We’re creating a new landscape for shoppable entertainment and digital experiences while continuing to
                meet our customers where they are, with the products they love. Most shopping in virtual worlds is
                currently limited to purchases of virtual currency and in-game digital items, with no easy path to
                purchase physical products. We want to change that. With World Store Anywhere, we’re bringing the
                convenience and ease of shopping in World Store stores to Peridot. There’s a sense of excitement in
                discovering unique and relevant items within the game that you can get delivered right to your door. You
                don’t have to leave your game or app to purchase physical products—simply enjoy your experience of
                engaging with the fun things you’ll find. Once you’re ready to buy, you can expect the same great
                selection, low prices, easy checkout, fast delivery, and best-in-class customer support as you would
                from shopping in World Store stores.</p>
